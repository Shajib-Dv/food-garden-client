## Installation :

### `Client site`

> Navigate to the project directory: cd `your directory name`

> Install the dependencies: `npm install`

> Start the development server: `npm run dev`

> Open the browser and visit: http://localhost:5173 or press the key [o] to open the site on your browser.

### `Server site`

> Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Shajib-Dv/food-garden-server.git

- Install the dependencies: `npm install`
- You need to connect in MongoDB by using uri (contact me to get it)
- Run the server: `npm start` or use `nodemon index.js` command.

### Note:

Please make sure that, you have run the server before run the client site. I have deployed the server on vercel. If you want to run it locally please replace `https://food-garden-server.vercel.app` with `http://localhost:5000` after run the server code.
